Arindam: Hey team, good morning! Thanks for joining. We’ve got an exciting project ahead—building an AI Agent Application. We need to plan this out carefully, including estimating the costs and outlining all the tasks. How’s everyone doing today?

Shivay: Morning, Arindam! I’m good, thanks. Building an AI Agent sounds awesome. What’s our initial approach?

Arindam: Our main goal is to develop an AI Agent Application that can automate tasks and assist users intelligently. We’ll need to decide on the core features, select the right models, and ensure a smooth user experience. As for costs, I estimate around $2,000 for initial development, including cloud hosting, API usage, and basic infrastructure. If we go for advanced features or premium models, it could go up to $5,000.

Amitesh: Sounds good. What features are we thinking about for the first version?

Arindam: Here’s what I have in mind:
- Basic agent: Task automation, answering queries, and scheduling.
- Pro agent: Integration with third-party APIs, advanced reasoning, and priority support.
- Enterprise agent: Custom workflows, team collaboration, and dedicated support.

We’ll need to set up these tiers in our app and make sure the pricing reflects the features. For infrastructure, we’ll use cloud services like AWS or Azure, and integrate with OpenAI or similar APIs.

Shivay: Got it. I’ll start on the frontend. For the user interface, should we keep it simple and focus on usability?

Arindam: Yes, keep it clean and intuitive. Users should easily understand what each agent tier offers. Let’s include a comparison table and clear call-to-action buttons. Also, add tooltips explaining upgrade options and feature differences.

Amitesh: On the backend, I’ll focus on integrating the AI models and setting up the API endpoints. We’ll need to handle user authentication, manage subscriptions, and process requests efficiently.

Arindam: Exactly. The backend should handle:
- Creating and managing agent sessions.
- Processing user requests and returning responses.
- Managing subscriptions and payments.
- Logging and monitoring for troubleshooting.

Shivay: For the dashboard, what functionalities do we need?

Arindam: The dashboard should show:
- Current agent tier and usage stats.
- Options to upgrade, downgrade, or cancel.
- Access to billing and payment history.
- Settings to customize the agent’s behavior.

Amitesh: We’ll also need to set up webhook handlers for events like subscription changes and payment updates. I’ll prepare a test plan to cover different scenarios, including failed payments and agent upgrades.

Shivay: Once the backend is ready, I’ll integrate the frontend with the API. We’ll make sure all changes are reflected in real-time and notify users of any important events.

Arindam: Perfect. Let’s aim to get the initial version done in three weeks, with a week for testing. During testing, we should cover all edge cases and ensure everything works smoothly.

Amitesh: I’ll document the API endpoints and webhook handlers for future maintenance. We should also prepare user documentation and a help section for common issues.

Shivay: Agreed. I’ll start on the frontend components and keep you updated. Let’s set up a follow-up meeting next week to review progress and address any blockers.

Arindam: Sounds good. If anyone needs help or runs into issues, reach out anytime. Let’s make this AI Agent Application a success!

Amitesh: Looking forward to it. I’ll get started on the backend setup.

Shivay: I’ll begin with the frontend design. Thanks, everyone!

Arindam: Great! Have a productive day, team.
