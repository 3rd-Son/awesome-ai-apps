A brief explanation of how the project works, from input to output.

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) or pip for package management
- API keys for the following services:
  - [Service 1 (e.g., Nebius AI)](https://example.com)
  - [Service 2 (e.g., Bright Data)](https://example.com)

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` or `api.env` file in the project root and add the following variables. Refer to the specific project's documentation for the exact file name and variables required.

```env
SERVICE1_API_KEY="your_service1_api_key"
SERVICE2_API_KEY="your_service2_api_key"
```

**Note:** Ensure that any phone numbers or client IDs are correctly formatted and registered with their respective services.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arindam200/awesome-llm-apps.git
   cd awesome-llm-apps/[project_directory]
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   - **Using `venv`:**
     ```bash
     python -m venv .venv
     source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   - **Using `uv` (recommended):**
     ```bash
     uv sync
     ```
   - **Using `pip`:**
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## ⚙️ Usage

1. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   or for background services:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:8501` (or as indicated by the application).

3. Follow the on-screen instructions, such as providing an API key or input URL.
